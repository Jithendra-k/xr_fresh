# xr_fresh
 
xr_fresh is designed to quickly generate a broad set of temporal features from gridded raster data time series. 


# Install
Installs easily on Linux, I recommend creating a conda environment for TimeFraym 
and activating it before installation.  

*Linux & Windows Install*

```
# clone environment
git clone https://github.com/fraymio/xr_fresh.git
cd ./xr_fresh 

# create conda environment 
conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
activate xr_fresh

# install xr_fresh package
pip install . e

```
